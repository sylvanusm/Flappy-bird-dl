Description: Show how a computer can learn to play Flappy Bird without any previous knowledge about the game, like a human would. This is done through deep reinforcement learning where the iterative decision to take for the bird is binary : whether “Fly up” or “Do nothing”. The environment is constrained by green pipes. 

Datasets: Flappy Bird clone game using PyGame (images)
